            <p>Greetings! ðŸŒŸ My name is Malav Gandhi, currently in my second year pursuing Information Technology at LJ Institute of Technology in Ahmedabad. Within the realm of technology, I've discovered a profound passion for coding that fuels my endeavors.</p>
            <br />
        <p>
        Coding is more than just a hobby to me. With a keen interest in web development, I've devoted considerable time to mastering its intricacies and have embarked on various projects that have contributed to my growth and proficiency.
        While I relish the challenges and creativity of web development, I'm also drawn to the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). I aspire to delve deeper into these fields, driven by the desire to understand and leverage their capabilities to address real-world problems.        </p>
